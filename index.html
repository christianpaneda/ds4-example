		<p>Los Angeles, California (LA) â€” where the sun sets every so brightly. From the food to the fashion, LA is my favorite place on earth for a variety of reasons, not to mention that the weather is almost always amazing! But what I love the most is the diversity of people. I appreciate all of the complex subcultures that exist in the 'city of stars.' Every day in LA feels like an adventure, and I am excited to share mine with you. Welcome to my personal blog! I hope to show you my favorite spots, recommendations, and memories I hold near and dear to my heart. I post content every two weeks, or whenever inspiration strikes me.</p>

		<p>My name is Christian Paneda, and I'm a midwest boy pretending to be a California boy. In other words, I pretend to be more cool than I actually am. I'm not saying that the midwest isn't cool though. I lived in LA for 1.5 years, and I'm excited to be coming back. I'm a grad student at the University of Michigan studying Human-Computer Interaction. I'm a product designer who loves to be creative. When I'm not coding or pushing pixels on a screen, I love to write and drink iced matcha lattes with almond milk. If you want to collab, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:christian-la@gmail.com">christian-la@gmail.com!</a> Also, this website is 100% fake. </p>
